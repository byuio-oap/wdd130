   <h2>Homemade meat lasagna, traditional Italian recipe</h2>
   <p>Meat lasagna is one of the most traditional recipes that we have in Italian gastronomy, today I am going to teach you how to make the traditional Italian lasagna recipe, the one that I was taught when I lived in Italy.</p>
   <p>This classic pasta recipe is made up of layers of pasta interspersed with a filling, usually meat, although we can also find vegetable lasagna, tuna lasagna or fish lasagna that is made in another recipe and includes a mixture of fish and seafood.</p>
   <h2>Ingridients:</h2>
   <ul>
    <li>500 grams of minced beef</li>
    <li>200 grams of mortadella (optional, we can put bacon)</li>
    <li>1 red bell pepper</li>
    <li>1 green bell pepper</li>
    <li>1 yellow bell pepper</li>
    <li>1 spring onion</li>
    <li>lasagna sheets</li>
    <li>200 ml of fried tomato</li>
    <li>1 glass of white wine or red wine</li>
    <li>Grated cheese (I use pecorino which is great)</li>
    <li>Salt</li>
    <li>Black pepper</li>
    <li>Bechame sauce</li>
    <h2>HOW TO PREPARE MEAT LASAGNA</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>We put the chopped onion together with the peppers to poach 10 or 15 minutes over low heat</li>
        <li>Once the vegetables are poached, add the minced meat and the minced mortadella.</li>
        <li>When the meat is half done, add the wine and let the alcohol evaporate. Next the homemade tomato sauce. You can perfectly use fried tomato sauce, but I always recommend homemade things, there are a lot of easy tomato sauce recipes on the internet for you to take a look at</li>
        <li>We make the bechamel on the other hand. Once done we can start assembling the lasagna.</li>
        <li> In a source we put bechamel in the bottom.</li>
        <li>Cover with the pasta sheets. These are from the barilla brand, we simply cover them with bechamel and in 30 minutes they will cook in the oven.</li>
        <li>Add the filling and add grated cheese. We repeat the operation to make another layer of lasagna.</li>
        <li>Cover with bechamel and grated cheese. Bake at 200ยบ for 20 minutes. And then 3 more minutes to gratin.</li>
